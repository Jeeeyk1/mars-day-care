-Our daycare center has a strict policy for sick children to prevent the spread of illness to other children and staff members. 
If a child is showing signs of illness, we request that they are kept home until they are fully recovered or receive medical clearance from a healthcare provider.
If a child becomes sick while at the daycare, we will isolate the child and immediately notify the parent or guardian to arrange for pick up.
We ask that parents come to pick up their child as soon as possible to minimize the risk of illness spreading to others.
5.What is your policy for communication with parents/guardians?
At our daycare center, we believe that clear and effective communication between our staff and parents/guardians is essential for providing the best care for the children. 
We make sure to keep parents/guardians informed about their child's progress, activities, and any issues that may arise during their time at the daycare.
We maintain an open-door policy and encourage parents/guardians to communicate with us about any concerns or questions they may have. We also use various communication 
channels such as emails, phone calls, and parent-teacher conferences to keep parents/guardians updated about their child's development and any important information 
related to the daycare.
